\subsection{Detailed Observations and Critique}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\textbf{Key Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ambiguity in project goals. No clear success metrics provided.
    \item Lack of differentiation between intended user groups (e.g., SOC analysts, executives).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define measurable outcomes, such as: "Reduce SOC analyst response time by 30%."
    \item Clearly specify use cases for each user group.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Overall Description}
\textbf{Key Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Over-reliance on Azure-specific services, ignoring multi-cloud or hybrid options.
    \item Unclear preconditions and dependencies for threat ingestion pipelines.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporate alternative cloud strategies for vendor neutrality.
    \item Document fallback mechanisms for precondition failures.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Specific Requirements}
\textbf{Functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FR-1 lacks details on API versioning and error handling mechanisms.
    \item FR-4 does not specify how RBAC will be enforced for different roles.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-Functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NFR-1 does not specify system recovery time after failure.
    \item NFR-3 encryption requirements omit specific compliance benchmarks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance API documentation with explicit error codes, rate limits, and versioning strategy.
    \item Specify encryption standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2) and recovery time objectives (RTO).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Testing and Risk Management}
\textbf{Key Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing strategies lack depth; no mention of parameterized tests or stress testing design.
    \item Risk table ignores critical risks, such as vendor lock-in and cascading failures.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Include examples of test cases, such as parameterized tests for API inputs and outputs.
    \item Expand risk assessment to include contingency plans for vendor lock-in.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System Architecture}
\textbf{Key Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inadequate focus on security layers in microservices.
    \item Over-reliance on Azure services without consideration of on-premise deployments.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define a layered security architecture for microservices.
    \item Provide an abstract deployment model adaptable to non-Azure environments.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Exam-Related Questions and Insights}
\subsection{Testing Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boundary Values Technique:} Applied to API rate limits and input validation.
    \item \textbf{Decision Table:} Omitted due to a lack of complex conditional logic in workflows.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit Testing and Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AAA Pattern:} Used for testing enrichment services by arranging test data, executing transformations, and asserting outputs.
    \item \textbf{Parameterized Tests:} Employed for API endpoint tests using frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.
    \item \textbf{Test Doubles:} Used mock databases and APIs to isolate components during integration tests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database and API Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Testing:} Validated schema integrity, query performance, and transactional consistency.
    \item \textbf{API Testing:} Designed contract tests for external APIs with Swagger and tested failure scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stress Tests:} Simulated ingestion of 100k IOCs to verify system resilience.
    \item \textbf{Spike Tests:} Tested system response to sudden surges in threat data ingestion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Answers for Theoretical Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Testing vs Debugging:} Testing identifies defects; debugging locates and resolves the cause.
    \item \textbf{Regression Testing:} Ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
    \item \textbf{Test Pyramid:} Prioritizes unit tests over integration and UI tests for efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{Overall Rating:} **3.5/5**  
While the document demonstrates potential for real-world application, it falls short in clarity, testing depth, and adaptability.

\end{document}  HERE is an example of markdown formatting As an **ISTQB-certified professional**, I will critically evaluate the artifact with a structured critique and provide an upgraded version that meets and exceeds the highest standards for a professional risk assessment document. This version will integrate **best practices in software quality assurance**, **risk-based testing approaches**, and **industry-leading methodologies** to ensure clarity, utility, and strategic alignment.

### **Critique of the Current Artifact**

1. **Lack of Strategic Depth in Risk Analysis**:
   - Risks are treated as static; there’s no dynamic evaluation of evolving risks over the software lifecycle.
   - Impact and likelihood ratings lack quantitative backing, reducing credibility.

2. **Ineffective Communication of Risk Prioritization**:
   - The risk matrices fail to emphasize critical risks that require immediate attention.
   - No focus on residual risks post-mitigation.

3. **Limited Integration of ISTQB Principles**:
   - Missing structured techniques such as cause-effect analysis, failure mode effect analysis (FMEA), and alignment with risk-based testing frameworks.

4. **Lack of Contextual Insights**:
   - No explicit link between the identified risks and business objectives, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand the potential consequences.

5. **Accessibility and Presentation Gaps**:
   - Dense tables and static visuals hinder readability and engagement.
   - Color-coded matrices lack WCAG compliance for accessibility.

### **Upgraded Artifact**

Below is the enhanced artifact that addresses these shortcomings while incorporating **ISTQB-aligned principles** and a **beyond-the-basics approach** for professional risk management.

### **5.1 Key Learnings**  
1. Risk tracking improved after integrating **ISTQB techniques** (e.g., boundary analysis, failure-based prioritization).  
2. Early-stage over-reliance on Azure could have been mitigated with earlier multi-cloud tests.  

### **5.2 Recommendations**  
- Adopt a continuous risk assessment process post-launch.  
- Automate compliance monitoring for ISO 27001 adherence.

The Second Mandatory Assignment constitutes the Exam Project.

The Exam Project will be developed in groups of 2 to 5 students. Please write down your names at https://studkea.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/TeamSOFT-E24-Testing/ESUSIQRlWK1Dk5Xc9hkRznQBd7bYemUaihbqVqV32Zu_rw?e=3ltWUZ.

Each group of students will perform diverse forms of testing and generate several deliverables on an application of their choice (either built specifically for this project, a repurposed app or even someone else’s code). The topic, business idea, specifications, type of application (web, mobile, standalone), programming language(s), DBMSs, test tools, continuous integration tools, and IDEs used will be decided by the students. However, the application must include the following:

A frontend
A backend with an API
A database
A connection to an external, public API (could be something simple like a weather widget)
Task list:

Review.
One member of the group will write an SRS (Software Requirements Specification) for the application in the format chosen by the students (it can be a series of user stories).
The remaining members will conduct a formal review and generate a review document.
Deliverables:
