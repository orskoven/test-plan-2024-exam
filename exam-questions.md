Precondition

As a precondition to take the exam, the students must submit a one-page pdf file on Wiseflow as a group. Said document must contain:

The names of the students
A brief description of the application on which the students are performing testing activities
A bullet point list of the expected testing activities the students will perform on said application
 

Description

The exam is physical, individual, oral, and internally censored.

Each student will connect his/her laptop to the classroomâ€™s projector. It is recommended to make sure that all relevant files and applications are already open before the exam starts (e.g., IDE, browser, CI jobs, stress performance testing tool, pdf files). It is also recommended that the state of the services is checked right before the exam (e.g., API, CI jobs).

The schedule will be made available on Wiseflow. According to KEA regulations, students can be required to take the exam up to one hour before their scheduled time. Be ready at least one hour in advance.

Each exam takes a maximum of 30 minutes, distributed as follows:

Max. 25 minutes. Exam:
Max. 10 minutes. The student presents his/her Exam Project
Max. 15 minutes. The examiners ask questions
5 minutes. The examiners grade the exam and communicate the grade to the student
Materials:

Only those submitted as the Exam Project.
No slides, Powerpoint files or similar presentation media are allowed.
Questions

These are some of the potential questions that will be asked at the exam:

Related to the Exam Project
Descriptive. Examples:
What criteria did you use to assign roles for your specification review?
How did you apply the boundary values technique to the design of test cases?
Why did you not create a decision table?

Discuss your use of the AAA pattern for your unit tests.
Show your use of parameterised tests/data providers.
Show how you used test doubles or, if you did not, explain why.
Explain how you tested the database.
Explain how you tested the external API.
Explain the design of your internal API tests.
Explain the design of your end-to-end tests.
