Comprehensive Migration Strategy: MySQL JPA to MongoDB CRUD Application

Overview

The provided authmoduleV application uses MySQL with JPA to implement a robust authentication and authorization system. The migration to MongoDB requires substantial changes, including modifying the data model, repositories, and associated business logic to utilize MongoDB’s NoSQL capabilities.

This document provides a concrete plan to achieve the migration while ensuring functional parity, data integrity, and minimal disruption.

Challenges and Key Considerations
	1.	Schema Migration: Converting relational entities with complex relationships into MongoDB’s document structure.
	2.	Data Consistency: Preserving relationships (e.g., User and RefreshToken) in a non-relational database.
	3.	Query Rewrites: Adapting SQL-based queries and JPA methods to MongoDB’s query mechanisms.
	4.	Performance Tuning: Optimizing MongoDB collections and queries for high performance.
	5.	Testing and Validation: Ensuring migrated functionalities work as expected.

Migration Plan

Phase 1: Preparation
	1.	Analysis of Existing Codebase
	•	Review all JPA entities, repositories, and service classes interacting with MySQL.
	•	Map relational data structures to MongoDB’s document model.
	2.	Technology Stack Updates
	•	Add Spring Data MongoDB to the project.
	•	Remove MySQL and JPA dependencies after completing migration.
	3.	Development Environment
	•	Set up a MongoDB database instance (local or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
	•	Use tools like mongorestore for data migration and MongoDB Compass for visualizing collections.

Phase 2: Schema Redesign
	1.	Mapping Relational to Document Structure
	•	Flatten relational entities into self-contained MongoDB documents.
	•	Use embedded documents for one-to-one or one-to-few relationships.
	•	Use references (DBRef or manual referencing) for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
	2.	Example Transformations
	•	User
	•	Include roles and privileges as arrays in the User document.
	•	Embed related tokens (e.g., RefreshToken, PasswordResetToken) as subdocuments for faster access.
	•	Role and Privilege
	•	Use a standalone Role collection if shared across multiple users.
	•	AuditLog
	•	Store logs as separate documents but reference users using their IDs.
	3.	Normalized Example: User Document

{
  "_id": "user123",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "enabled": true,
  "roles": ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"],
  "refreshTokens": [
    {
      "token": "abcd1234",
      "expiryDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "auditLogs": [
    {
      "action": "LOGIN_SUCCESS",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
      "timestamp": "2023-12-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

Phase 3: Code Migration
	1.	Repository Migration
	•	Replace JpaRepository with MongoRepository.
	•	Rewrite repository methods using MongoDB query syntax.
	•	Examples:
	•	MySQL JPA: Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
	•	MongoDB:

Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);


	2.	Service Layer Adaptation
	•	Rewrite service methods to use MongoDB repositories.
	•	Adjust data-fetching logic for embedded and referenced documents.
	3.	Entity Annotations
	•	Replace JPA annotations (e.g., @Entity, @Table) with MongoDB equivalents (e.g., @Document).
	•	Examples:

@Document(collection = "users")
public class User {
  @Id
  private String id;
  private String username;
  private String email;
  private List<String> roles;
}


	4.	Query Rewrites
	•	Replace JPQL queries with MongoDB queries.
	•	Use @Query annotation for custom MongoDB queries if needed.

Phase 4: Data Migration
	1.	Data Export
	•	Export MySQL data using tools like mysqldump or custom scripts.
	2.	Data Transformation
	•	Transform relational data into MongoDB’s JSON format using ETL tools (e.g., Talend, Pentaho) or custom scripts.
	3.	Data Import
	•	Import transformed data into MongoDB using mongoimport.

Phase 5: Testing
	1.	Unit and Integration Testing
	•	Update test cases for the new MongoDB repositories.
	•	Use in-memory MongoDB (e.g., Flapdoodle) for testing.
	2.	Functional Testing
	•	Validate all API endpoints using tools like Postman.
	•	Ensure functional parity with the MySQL-backed implementation.
	3.	Performance Testing
	•	Benchmark MongoDB queries and compare performance against MySQL.
	•	Optimize indexes and query patterns based on results.
	4.	Regression Testing
	•	Ensure no existing functionality is broken post-migration.

Phase 6: Deployment
	1.	Database Switch
	•	Update application configurations to use the MongoDB database.
	•	Deploy MongoDB to production (use replicas for high availability).
	2.	Monitoring
	•	Set up monitoring for MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, Prometheus, Datadog).
	•	Monitor application performance and database metrics.
	3.	Rollback Plan
	•	Maintain a backup of MySQL and MongoDB data to revert if needed.

Post-Migration
	1.	Documentation
	•	Update developer documentation to reflect MongoDB usage.
	•	Provide guidelines for writing efficient MongoDB queries.
	2.	Continuous Improvement
	•	Periodically review database performance.
	•	Optimize schema and queries based on application usage patterns.
