	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 200 with user details; verification email is sent.

Test Case FT-004: User Registration with Duplicate Username

	•	Objective: Ensure that registration fails if the username already exists.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Send a POST request to /register with an existing username.
	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 400 Bad Request with a relevant error message.

Test Case FT-005: Password Reset Request

	•	Objective: Verify that a password reset email is sent to the user.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Send a POST request to /reset-password with a registered email address.
	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 200 with a confirmation message; email is sent.

Security Tests

Test Case ST-001: SQL Injection Attempt on Login

	•	Objective: Test input sanitization against SQL injection.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Send a POST request to /login with username set to admin'-- and any password.
	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 401 Unauthorized; application remains secure.

Test Case ST-002: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Registration

	•	Objective: Ensure that the application is protected against XSS attacks.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Send a POST request to /register with username set to <script>alert('XSS')</script>.
	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 400 Bad Request; input is sanitized.

Test Case ST-003: Rate Limiting Enforcement

	•	Objective: Confirm that rate limiting is correctly implemented.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Send more than 5 login requests within 60 seconds from the same IP with invalid credentials.
	•	Expected Result: Receive HTTP 429 Too Many Requests after the 5th attempt.

Performance Tests

Test Case PT-001: Load Testing Login Endpoint

	•	Objective: Assess performance under normal load.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Simulate 100 concurrent users sending login requests over 5 minutes.
	•	Expected Result: Average response time under 500ms; no errors.

Test Case PT-002: Stress Testing Login Endpoint

	•	Objective: Determine the system’s breaking point.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Gradually increase the number of concurrent users until the system degrades.
	•	Expected Result: Identify the maximum load before response times exceed acceptable thresholds.

Usability Tests

Test Case UT-001: Clarity of Error Messages

	•	Objective: Ensure error messages are user-friendly and informative.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Trigger various errors (e.g., invalid input, unauthorized access).
	•	Expected Result: Error messages are clear, concise, and helpful without revealing sensitive information.

Defects and Observations

Defect D-001: Rate Limiting Not Enforced (Critical)

	•	Description: The rate limiting mechanism on the /login endpoint is not functioning, allowing unlimited login attempts.
	•	Impact: High risk of brute-force attacks.
	•	Recommendation: Review and fix the rate_limiter decorator implementation.

Defect D-002: Weak Passwords Allowed (High)

	•	Description: The validate_password_strength function allows passwords that do not meet complexity requirements.
	•	Impact: Increases vulnerability to account compromise.
	•	Recommendation: Strengthen the password validation logic and enforce stricter policies.

Defect D-003: Uninformative Error Messages (Medium)

	•	Description: Error messages are too generic, which can hinder user experience.
	•	Impact: Users may not understand why their request failed.
	•	Recommendation: Provide more specific error messages while avoiding information leakage.

Risk Assessment

Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation
Rate limiting failure leading to DoS	High	Critical	Fix rate limiter; add unit tests to cover this functionality
Weak password acceptance	Medium	High	Enforce strong password policies
Sensitive data exposure through errors	Low	Medium	Review error handling to prevent information disclosure

Recommendations

	1.	Fix Rate Limiting Issue: Investigate the rate_limiter decorator to ensure it correctly tracks and limits requests.
	2.	Enhance Password Validation: Update validate_password_strength to enforce the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters with a minimum length of 8.
	3.	Improve Error Messages: Adjust error responses to be informative yet secure, helping users understand the issue without revealing system details.
	4.	Implement Unit Tests: Increase code coverage, especially around critical areas like security mechanisms.
	5.	Security Audit: Conduct a thorough security audit using tools like bandit and OWASP ZAP to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

While the auth_router.py module provides essential authentication functionalities, critical security issues need to be addressed to meet Fortune 10 ISTQB standards. Immediate action is required to fix the rate limiting and password validation defects to safeguard the application against potential attacks.
