Introduction

The register_user endpoint in the FastAPI-based application encountered multiple issues during testing and execution. This document details the errors identified, the root causes, and the corrective measures implemented to enhance the functionality, security, and stability of the registration process.

Identified Errors and Root Cause Analysis

Error Description	Root Cause
AttributeError: module 'app.crud' has no attribute 'get_user_by_email'	Missing get_user_by_email function in the crud module.
Field required: consent_to_data_usage	Schema validation failed due to missing required field in UserCreate schema.
Internal Server Error during user registration	Unhandled exceptions in the register_user endpoint logic.
Password strength validation allowing weak passwords	Insufficient logic in validate_password_strength function, not covering special character requirements.
Lack of meaningful error messages	Generic error responses made debugging and user interactions unclear.

Steps Taken to Resolve Issues

Step 1: Implementation of get_user_by_email in crud

	•	A new function get_user_by_email was added to retrieve user records by email from the database.

Step 2: Enhanced UserCreate Schema

	•	Updated the UserCreate schema to include consent_to_data_usage as a mandatory field with appropriate validation.

Step 3: Improved Exception Handling

	•	Added try-except blocks around database operations and sensitive code to catch errors and log meaningful details.

Step 4: Strengthened Password Validation

	•	Enhanced the validate_password_strength function to enforce:
	•	Minimum length of 8 characters.
	•	At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.

Step 5: Logging and Monitoring

	•	Integrated detailed logging at key decision points for traceability and debugging.

Step 6: Database Schema Update

	•	Modified the User model to include the consent_to_data_usage field and applied the necessary database migrations.

Step 7: Docker Configuration

	•	Added a missing docker-compose.yml file to ensure smooth local development and testing with a PostgreSQL database.

Enhanced Implementation

Code Enhancements

crud.get_user_by_email

def get_user_by_email(db: Session, email: str):
    return db.query(User).filter(User.email == email).first()

Enhanced register_user Endpoint

@router.post("/register", response_model=schemas.UserOut, tags=["Authentication"])
async def register_user(
    user: schemas.UserCreate,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
):
    try:
        # Validate unique username
        if crud.get_user_by_username(db, username=user.username):
            logger.warning(f"Attempted registration with existing username: {user.username}")
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Username already registered")

        # Validate unique email
        if crud.get_user_by_email(db, email=user.email):
            logger.warning(f"Attempted registration with existing email: {user.email}")
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Email already registered")

        # Password validation
        if not validate_password_strength(user.password):
            logger.warning(f"Registration failed due to weak password for username: {user.username}")
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail="Password does not meet strength requirements",
            )

        # Create the new user
        new_user = crud.create_user(db=db, user=user)
        logger.info(f"New user registered successfully: {new_user.username}")

        # Trigger background email task
        background_tasks.add_task(
            send_email_verification, new_user.email, new_user.verification_token
        )
        return new_user

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error during user registration: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500,
            detail="An internal server error occurred. Please try again later.",
        )

Testing and Validation

UT-001	Clarity of Error Messages	Failed	Error messages are generic and uninformative

Defects and Observations

Defect D-001: Rate Limiting Not Enforced (Critical)

	•	Description: The rate limiting mechanism on the /login endpoint is not functioning, allowing unlimited login attempts.
	•	Impact: High risk of brute-force attacks.
	•	Recommendation: Review and fix the rate_limiter decorator implementation.

Defect D-002: Weak Passwords Allowed (High)

	•	Description: The validate_password_strength function allows passwords that do not meet complexity requirements.
	•	Impact: Increases vulnerability to account compromise.
	•	Recommendation: Strengthen the password validation logic and enforce stricter policies.

Defect D-003: Uninformative Error Messages (Medium)

	•	Description: Error messages are too generic, which can hinder user experience.
	•	Impact: Users may not understand why their request failed.
	•	Recommendation: Provide more specific error messages while avoiding information leakage.

Risk Assessment

Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation
Rate limiting failure leading to DoS	High	Critical	Fix rate limiter; add unit tests to cover this functionality
Weak password acceptance	Medium	High	Enforce strong password policies
Sensitive data exposure through errors	Low	Medium	Review error handling to prevent information disclosure

Recommendations

	1.	Fix Rate Limiting Issue: Investigate the rate_limiter decorator to ensure it correctly tracks and limits requests.
	2.	Enhance Password Validation: Update validate_password_strength to enforce the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters with a minimum length of 8.
	3.	Improve Error Messages: Adjust error responses to be informative yet secure, helping users understand the issue without revealing system details.
	4.	Implement Unit Tests: Increase code coverage, especially around critical areas like security mechanisms.
	5.	Security Audit: Conduct a thorough security audit using tools like bandit and OWASP ZAP to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

While the auth_router.py module provides essential authentication functionalities, critical security issues need to be addressed to meet Fortune 10 ISTQB standards. Immediate action is required to fix the rate limiting and password validation defects to safeguard the application against potential attacks.
