# Professional Testing Plan for Migrating from MySQL to MongoDB

## Executive Summary

This report outlines a comprehensive strategy to ensure a smooth and reliable migration from **MySQL** to **MongoDB** for a Fortune 10 company operating in a real-world, high-stakes environment. The migration is driven by the need to scale horizontally, leverage schema-less flexibility, and improve performance for unstructured and semi-structured data. Given the critical nature of the application, the testing plan focuses on **data integrity**, **system performance**, **compatibility**, and **functional equivalence**.

---

## Objectives

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure all data is migrated correctly without any loss or corruption.
2. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark MongoDB against MySQL under production-like loads.
3. **Feature Parity**: Validate that all application functionalities relying on MySQL are fully operational with MongoDB.
4. **Compatibility**: Confirm integration with downstream systems, APIs, and analytics pipelines.
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Test and validate rollback mechanisms and backup procedures during migration.

---

## Key Challenges

- Migrating relational schemas to a NoSQL model without loss of semantics.
- Rewriting and testing application queries for MongoDB.
- Ensuring zero downtime or minimal disruption to business operations.
- Scaling MongoDB clusters for enterprise-grade performance.

## Migration Testing Strategy

### 1. **Pre-Migration Phase**

#### 1.1 Data Analysis
- Analyze MySQL schemas and relationships (ER diagrams).
- Define MongoDB document structure using best practices for denormalization and sharding.
- Identify data types and edge cases (e.g., NULL values, foreign keys, etc.).

#### 1.2 Testing Environment Setup
- Spin up dedicated staging environments for MySQL and MongoDB with production-scale datasets.
- Establish replication mechanisms using tools like **MongoDB Atlas** or **Debezium** for real-time sync.

#### 1.3 Baseline Performance Metrics
- Benchmark MySQL performance under typical production load (queries per second, response times, etc.).
- Define KPIs for MongoDB to ensure equal or better performance.

### 2. **Migration Testing Phase**

#### 2.1 Data Migration Validation
- **Tool Selection**: Use tools like **MongoDB's Database Tools**, **Talend**, or **Apache Nifi** for migration.
- **Row-by-Row Validation**: 
  - Verify record counts in MongoDB match those in MySQL.
  - Perform checksums to validate data integrity for large datasets.
- **Schema Validation**:
  - Validate MongoDB's schema alignment with application requirements.
  - Run automated schema comparison tests using tools like **JSON Schema Validator**.

#### 2.2 Functional Testing
- Rewrite SQL queries into MongoDB queries (using aggregation pipelines).
- Perform functional tests for all application endpoints and business workflows.
  - E.g., User authentication, search functionalities, reporting systems.

#### 2.3 Performance Testing
- Use tools like **JMeter**, **Gatling**, or **Locust** to simulate production-like loads.
- Measure:
  - Query response times.
  - Latency under high concurrent user traffic.
  - MongoDB cluster performance with different shard configurations.
- Compare with MySQL baselines to validate improvements.

#### 2.4 Compatibility Testing
- Validate integration with:
  - Data warehouses and ETL pipelines.
  - External APIs and microservices consuming the database.
  - Reporting and analytics tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
- Ensure that MongoDB's JSON responses are compatible with downstream systems.

#### 2.5 Edge Case and Boundary Testing
- Test for edge cases such as:
  - Large document sizes (exceeding BSON limits).
  - Complex aggregation pipelines.
  - Write-heavy workloads for MongoDB's **write concern** behavior.
  - Network partition scenarios.

#### 2.6 Rollback Testing
- Simulate rollback scenarios:
  - Restore MySQL from backups.
  - Validate data consistency post-rollout.

---

### 3. **Post-Migration Phase**

#### 3.1 Regression Testing
- Perform end-to-end regression tests on the migrated system to ensure no unintended side effects.
- Validate all application workflows in production-like environments.

#### 3.2 Monitoring and Observability
- Set up monitoring for MongoDB clusters (using tools like **MongoDB Atlas Monitor**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus**).
- Test alert mechanisms for:
  - Latency spikes.
  - Disk space usage.
  - Cluster node failures.

#### 3.3 Disaster Recovery and Backup Testing
- Test MongoDB backup and restore processes.
- Simulate disaster recovery scenarios and validate **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**.
